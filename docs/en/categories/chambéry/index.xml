<p>In today&rsquo;s post, I would like to share my recent experience of pregnancy and childbirth in Chambéry, France. I’ll skip unnecessary details, so this article is also suitable for men.</p>
<p>First of all, I noticed that pregnancy in France is approached in a more relaxed and natural way than what I’ve heard from friends and family in Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where the healthcare system often tries to &ldquo;save&rdquo; or &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; a pregnancy, here it is not seen as something that must be controlled from day one.</p>
<p>A woman’s social life, as a rule, doesn’t change much. More often, until the end of the first trimester, doctors don’t take the pregnancy too seriously. I mean that everything is expected to go naturally, and unless the woman is in a truly critical condition, nobody will hospitalize her “for observation” at this stage. No special check-ups or hormone therapy are prescribed.</p>]]></description>
