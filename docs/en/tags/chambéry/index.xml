    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-french-approach-to-pregnancy-and-its-management">The French approach to pregnancy and its management.</h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s post, I would like to share my recent pregnancy and childbirth experience in Chambéry, France. I’ll skip unnecessary details, so this article is suitable for men.</p>
<p>One of the first thing that really caught my attention was how relaxed and natural the attitude towards pregnancy is in France — especially compared to the stories I’ve heard from friends and family back in Ukraine. Unlike in Ukraine, where the healthcare system often tries to &ldquo;save&rdquo; or &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; a pregnancy, here, it is not seen as something that must be controlled from day one.</p>
<p>A woman’s social life, as a rule, doesn’t change much. More often, until the end of the first trimester, doctors don’t take the pregnancy too seriously. I mean that everything is expected to go naturally, and unless the woman is in a truly critical condition, nobody will hospitalize her “for observation” at this stage. No special check-ups or hormone therapy are prescribed.</p>]]></description>
