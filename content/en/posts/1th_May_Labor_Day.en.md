## From protests to a symbol of tenderness

Today is May 1st — International Labor Day. A holiday with a curious fate. Officially international, yet in Ukraine it still echoes the Soviet past. These days, May 1st is simply a day off, without marches or major celebrations.

I grew up in post-Soviet Ukraine. Not during the Soviet calendar — but right after it. And even when we think we’ve changed the calendar, the past still shines through the new pages. We build the future, but often on an old foundation.

## Memories of May

At school, right before the May holidays, we were sent to do a volunteer community clean-ups, we called it subbotnik. We, kids, actually enjoyed it — skipping class, being outside. I remember how hot it felt when we swept the streets, and the smell of dust in the air. Funny, but it feels cozy now when I think about it.

For me as a schoolgirl, May 1st wasn’t really about labour. It was a sign that holidays and coatless walks were near.

For our parents, May 1st was about demonstrations, union banners, orchestras. Whatever one thinks of it — it left a mark.

Even back then, the meaning of the day was shifting — from workers' struggle to picnics and processions. Eventually, it faded into a day for barbecue smoke and spring outings. Labour and solidarity — now just words printed on greeting cards.

## May Day on the Danube

About twelve years ago, my husband and I found ourselves in Budapest on May 1st. We stumbled upon a parade — planes and helicopters performing above the Danube, boats parading on the water. It was a real celebration. Beautiful. Shared.

## A French Bouquet

While living in Chambéry, I noticed something special: every year on May 1st, people sell lily of the valley flowers. On this day, anyone can sell them without a license. So you can see children with baskets, old ladies selling flowers on the street, and charities collecting money.

In France, May 1st is not only Labour Day. It is also the day when people give each other small bouquets of these delicate flowers — for good luck. It is not just a nice gesture, but a real tradition with royal roots.

## A Flower of Solidarity

There is a beautiful story: in 1560, a young king, Charles IX, visited the Dauphiné region in southeast France. Someone gave him a lily of the valley as a gift — a symbol of spring and good luck. He liked this idea and asked to give these flowers to the ladies at court every year on May 1st. We don’t know if this story is 100% true, but the tradition continued.

Later, when May 1st became Labour Day, the flower stayed. In 1941, it officially replaced the red carnation — a symbol of the workers' movement. So this little wild flower became a symbol of both spring and solidarity.

## A Spring Amulet

The main region for growing lily of the valley is Nantes. In France, this flower is a symbol of happiness. Giving it on May 1st means you wish someone good luck and joy. It’s a sign of spring and new beginnings, of warm feelings. It shows care and kindness — especially when the bouquet is picked by hand.

My neighbour, who is about the same age as my parents, told me that many people keep their dried bouquet for a whole year. It reminds them of someone’s attention and a May morning when the world felt a little kinder and brighter.
